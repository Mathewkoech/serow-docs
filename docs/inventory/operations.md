Update only the items that were physically counted, leaving others unchanged.

**Steps:**
1. Go to **Inventory** > **Stock Take** > **New**
2. Select **Branch/Warehouse**
3. Choose items to count (or scan all)
4. Enter physical count for each item
5. Click **Update Counted**
6. System adjusts only counted items

**Use When:**
- Conducting cycle counts
- Counting specific categories
- Spot-checking high-value items
- Partial warehouse counts

### Option 2: Update All Items
**Use with caution - sets uncounted items to zero**

Update all items in the stock take. Items not counted will be set to zero or marked as missing.

**Steps:**
1. Go to **Inventory** > **Stock Take** > **New**
2. Select **Branch/Warehouse**
3. **Count ALL items** in the location
4. Enter physical counts
5. Click **Update All**
6. System adjusts ALL items (uncounted = 0)

**Use When:**

- Annual inventory audits
- Complete branch stock verification
- Warehouse closure counts

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This option will zero out any items not included in your count. Only use when you've counted your entire inventory.

### Stock Take Best Practices
- **Plan ahead** - Schedule during low-activity periods
- **Use teams** - Divide warehouse into sections
- **Double count** - Have high-value items counted twice
- **Document** - Take photos of discrepancies
- **Regular cycles** - Count A-items monthly, B-items quarterly
- **Investigate** - Research large variances before adjusting

### Handling Discrepancies
1. Review count accuracy
2. Check recent transactions
3. Investigate missing items
4. Document findings
5. Create adjustments if needed
6. Update security if theft suspected
