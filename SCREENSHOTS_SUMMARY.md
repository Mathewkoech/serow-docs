## 🎯 To Add Your Screenshots

### Option 1: Save Screenshots Now

```bash
cd /home/mathew/Documents/projects/serow/serow-docs

# Save your screenshots with these exact names:
# 1. Save login screenshot as: docs/assets/images/login-screen.png
# 2. Save signup screenshot as: docs/assets/images/signup-screen.png
# 3. Save dashboard screenshot as: docs/assets/images/analytics-dashboard.png
```

Then edit these files to replace placeholders:

1. **`getting-started.md`** - Replace 2 placeholders (signup + login)
2. **`docs/analytics/dashboards.md`** - Replace 1 placeholder (dashboard)

### Option 2: Keep Placeholders for Now

The documentation works perfectly with placeholders! They clearly show:
- ✅ Where screenshots will go

- ✅ Exact filename to use

Users can still understand and use the documentation.
